      <article class="main">Interoperability in Healthcare means the ability of two  or more Health systems to use and exchange both  computer interpretable data and human understandable  information and knowledge.
It enables disparate healthcare systems to communicate  and share vital patient data in a standardized and  meaningful way.

  Example: 
        <p> when a patient moves to a new city, interoperability allows his or her electronic health records  (EHRs) to be quickly and securely transferred to his or her new physician. This ensures that the new  healthcare team has instant access to the medical history, diagnoses, medication records, and allergies,  facilitating efficient and informed care delivery for better health outcomes.</footer>
